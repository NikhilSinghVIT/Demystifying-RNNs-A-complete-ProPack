Google defines the word Demistifying as "make (a difficult subject) clearer and easier to understand."

And that is what we are doing here exactly, demistifying RNNs....
This ProPack contains 5 notebooks which covers topic like AutoRegressive model,SimpleRNN,LSTM,GRU.

This ProPack shows practically how SimpleRNNs face the problem of vanishing gradient and are not able to learn from inputs that are far back
in the sequence.
It also shows why LSTM and GRU works better in such cases and how to improve LSTMs when the sequence length is extended to such an 
extent that even LSTMs fail.
